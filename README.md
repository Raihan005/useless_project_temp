### Project Description
[NotYoTherapist is an anti-therapist chatbot that provides unfiltered, often humorous advice using personalities like "Kanye West","Gordon Ramsay." and many more. It‚Äôs here to give users the sass and sarcasm therapy they didn‚Äôt know they needed.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[With a surplus of calm and gentle chatbots, there‚Äôs a serious lack of "tell-it-like-it-is" AI. NotYoTherapist was created to fill this absolutely non-existent gap.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[NotYoTherapist offers a sass-filled alternative to standard therapy bots. With custom personalities, it delivers blunt advice, unfiltered opinions, and occasionally absurd responses.]
